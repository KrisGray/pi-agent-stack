# Pack: script

Compose with: `cli-tool` when it is reused or distributed, `batch-worker` when
something other than a person starts it, `data-pipeline` when it moves data on a
schedule. See the boundary tests in `PACKS.md` — this pack is the one most often
routed to by mistake.

A standalone script or small tool. Short pack — four questions, and often fewer are
needed. Assumes the core bank has run.

The failure mode this pack exists to catch: scripts become infrastructure without anyone
deciding that they should. Q1 and Q2 are there to make that decision explicit rather than
retrospective.

1. Is this run once, or does it become something that runs again? [default: once]

2. Who runs it? [default: you]
   - → *follow-up:* where does it run — your machine, a server, or a scheduler?
     [default: your machine, by hand]
   *(If Q1 said "once" and this follow-up names a scheduler or another person, those
   answers contradict each other. Take your one follow-up here — it is the
   highest-value follow-up in this pack.)*

3. Does it change anything that can't be undone — writes, deletes, sends, spends?
   [default: read-only]
   - → *if yes:* does it need to be rehearsed against real data before it runs for real?

4. If it stops halfway, is it safe to just run it again? [default: yes]

## Notes for the PRD

- A script that is genuinely run once, by one person, read-only, is usually a
  **single-task scope**. Keep the PRD and feature graph minimal (one requirement,
  explicit non-goals) instead of expanding it into a platform.
- Anything that answers "repeatedly" to Q1 or names a scheduler in Q2 should be routed to
  a fuller pack instead. Use the boundary tests in `PACKS.md`: another person runs it →
  `cli-tool`; a scheduler or queue starts it → `batch-worker`; it moves data on a
  schedule → `data-pipeline`. Re-routing costs no question.
- A Q3 answer that is not read-only makes Q4 a requirement rather than a preference.
