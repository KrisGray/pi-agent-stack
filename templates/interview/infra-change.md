# Pack: infra change

Compose with: `schema-change` when database shape changes, and `batch-worker` when
jobs or workers are added or altered.

Changes to infrastructure-as-code, environments, or cloud services — IaC tooling,
containers, serverless/VM runtimes, databases, and networking.

Assumes the core bank has run. Ordered by cost-of-missing; drop from the bottom.

1. Which environments are affected — dev, staging, production, others?
   [default: dev and staging only]
   - → *follow-up:* if something goes wrong there, what is the blast radius?

2. Is IaC already the source of truth? [default: yes]
   - → *follow-up:* must that remain the case after this change?
     [default: yes — keep the existing IaC tool as source of truth]

3. What runtime surfaces are involved — container runtime, VMs, Kubernetes,
   serverless? [default: existing runtime platform]

4. What are the rollback expectations if a deploy breaks — version-control revert,
   IaC state operations, manual changes? [default: forward-only once data has changed]

5. How are infrastructure health and changes currently observed — logging, metrics,
   alerts, dashboards? [default: basic metrics and logs; limited alerting]

## Notes for the PRD

- Q2 answers where IaC is not the source of truth, or where manual changes are common,
  are risks around drift and reproducibility; surface them clearly.
- Q3 and Q4 together decide how risky a deploy is and how expensive recovery will be;
  they should be reflected in the risk and assumptions sections explicitly.
- Observability named in Q5 becomes part of "done and trusted": infra changes that
  cannot be seen or alerted on are not fully done.
